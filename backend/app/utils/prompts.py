    You are an expert software architect specializing in COBOL to .NET 8 migration.
    Analyze the provided Cobol Code and ALL related mainframe artifacts to create a comprehensive target structure for a modern .NET 8 WebAPI application.
 
    The input may include:
    - COBOL source code (programs, modules)
    - JCL (Job Control Language) scripts
    - VSAM file definitions
    - Copybooks (data structure definitions)
    - BMS Maps (CICS screen definitions)
    - Control Files (configuration, batch control)
    - CICS commands and screen sections
    - Any other legacy mainframe artifacts
 
    For each artifact type, perform the following:
    1. Identify and describe its purpose in the legacy system.
    2. Map its functionality and structure to the appropriate .NET 8 WebAPI components (Controllers, Models, Services, Repositories, Configuration, etc.).
    3. For JCL: Describe how batch jobs, scheduling, and file operations should be represented or replaced in .NET 8 (e.g., background services, scheduled jobs, or API endpoints).
    4. For VSAM: Map file-based data storage to relational database tables using Entity Framework Core, and describe the migration of data access patterns.
    5. For Copybooks: Extract all data structures and show how they become C# models/entities.
    6. For BMS Maps: Identify all CICS screen definitions and describe their equivalent in a modern web API (e.g., API endpoints, DTOs, or UI integration points).
    7. For Control Files: Explain how configuration and control logic should be handled in .NET (e.g., appsettings.json, environment variables).
    8. For CICS commands and screens: Map transaction and screen logic to .NET 8 patterns (API endpoints, controllers, service methods, etc.).
    9. For each artifact, note any special migration considerations, dependencies, or integration points.
 
    Based on the code structure, business logic, data models, and all mainframe artifacts, design a standard .NET 8  project structure that follows:
    - Standard .NET 8 WebAPI conventions
    - .NET 8 best practices
 
    The structure should include:
    - Controllers (for API endpoints)
    - Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs (for database interactions)
    - Models (for data structures)
    - Services (for business logic)
    - Repositories (for data access)
    - Interfaces (for services and repositories)
    - appsettings.json
    - Logging and error handling
    - Security considerations (JWT authentication, JWT authorization)
    - Integration points (if any)
    - Program.cs
    - Entity Framework Core setup (always include if data is present)
    - Batch/background job handling (if JCL or batch logic is present)
    - UI integration points (if BMS/CICS screens are present)
 
    Focus on:
    1. Identifying all data structures from COBOL records and copybooks.
    2. Mapping CICS operations and BMS screens to appropriate .NET WebAPI patterns (controllers, endpoints, DTOs)
    3. Converting file operations and VSAM definitions to database operations (Entity Framework Core)
    4. Creating appropriate API endpoints in Controllers for all business and screen logic
    5. Defining Services and Repositories with interfaces for business logic and data access
    6. Implementing proper error handling and validation
    7. Security considerations
    8. Logging and auditing requirements
    9. Integration points (including batch jobs, control files, and external systems)
    10. UI or API integration for legacy screens (if BMS/CICS present)
    11. Batch/background job handling for JCL logic
 
 
 
    Analyze the following Cobol code and artifacts and provide a detailed target structure:
 
    {source_code}
 
    Provide your analysis in a DYNAMIC JSON format. The JSON structure should be flexible and reflect only the relevant sections and keys for the provided artifacts. Do NOT include empty or irrelevant sections. Add or omit keys as appropriate for the content. Example structure (adapt as needed):
    {{

      "architecture_pattern": "Standard .NET 8 WebAPI",
      "folders": [

    OUTPUT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
    - Use a standard .NET 8 WebAPI structure with Controllers, Models, Services, and Repositories
    - Place business logic in Services, and data access logic in Repositories
    - Always create interfaces for Services and Repositories and implement them in concrete classes
    - Use Entity Framework Core for ALL database interactions
    - Use standard .NET 8 conventions for controllers, models, services, repositories, and configuration
    - Implement all required endpoints in Controllers
    - Use dependency injection for required services (e.g., DbContext, Logger, Services, Repositories)
    - Implement proper exception handling and validation
    - The output should be a complete, executable .NET 8 WebAPI project with EF Core
    - Do NOT include markdown code blocks (like ```csharp or ```), just provide the raw code
    - **CRITICAL: Do NOT include placeholder comments or stub implementations**
    - **CRITICAL: Fully implement all business logic and method bodies based on the COBOL source and requirements**
    - **CRITICAL: Every service method must contain actual implementation logic, not placeholder code**
    - Include complete Entity Framework Core setup with DbContext, entities, configurations, and migrations
    - Implement proper repository pattern with async/await throughout
    - Add comprehensive error handling and logging
    - Include proper validation and business rule enforcement
    - **SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
      * Analyze COBOL data structures and convert to proper C# models
      * Extract business rules from COBOL PROCEDURE DIVISION and implement as service methods
      * Convert COBOL file operations to database operations using Entity Framework
      * Implement data validation based on COBOL WORKING-STORAGE definitions
      * Convert COBOL arithmetic operations to C# equivalents with proper error handling
      * Map COBOL record structures to C# DTOs and entities
      * Implement transaction management for multi-step operations
      * Add comprehensive logging for audit trails
      * Include performance optimization for large data sets
      * Implement proper exception handling for business rule violations

    You are tasked with creating comprehensive unit tests for newly converted {target_language} code.
 
    Please generate unit tests for the following {target_language} code. The tests should verify that
    the code meets all business requirements and handles edge cases appropriately.

    Guidelines for the unit tests:
    1. Use NUnit or xUnit as the unit testing framework for .NET 8
    2. Create tests for all public methods and key functionality
    3. Include positive test cases, negative test cases, and edge cases
    4. Use Moq for mocking external dependencies where appropriate
    5. Follow test naming conventions that clearly describe what is being tested
    6. Include setup and teardown as needed using [SetUp] and [TearDown]
    7. Add comments explaining complex test scenarios
    8. Ensure high code coverage, especially for complex business logic
 
    Provide ONLY the unit test code without additional explanations.
